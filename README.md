## 📁 File Overview

### 11-todo-list.html  
A complete Todo List project using arrays, loops, and DOM manipulation. Users can add tasks with due dates and delete them dynamically.

---

### 11-arrays-and-loops.html  
A collection of exercises to practice arrays, loops (`for`, `while`), and logic like `break`, `continue`, and early returns from functions.

---

### 04-website.html  
A basic HTML page used to practice embedding JavaScript. Serves as a starting point to test out simple scripts.

---

### 05-variables.html  
Covers variable declaration in JavaScript using `let`, `const`, and `var`, and explores basic operations like arithmetic and logging output to the console.

---

### 05-cart-quantity.html  
A mini cart quantity tracker. Demonstrates using variables and button interactions to update quantity in a shopping cart scenario.

---

### 06-booleans.html  
Introduces booleans and conditional logic (`if`, `else`). Demonstrates decision-making based on true/false values.

---

### 06-rock-paper-scissors.html  
The first version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. Uses conditional logic to determine game results with hardcoded button logic.

---

### 07-functions.html  
Shows how to define and call functions. Includes examples of reusable logic and parameters, including a simple tax calculator.

---

### 07-rock-paper-scissors.html  
Refactored Rock Paper Scissors game using functions to clean up repetitive code. Better structured and easier to maintain.

---

### 08-objects.html  
Demonstrates how to create and manipulate JavaScript objects. Covers nested objects, methods inside objects, destructuring, and JSON serialization.

---

### 08-rock-paper-scissors.html  
Final version of Rock Paper Scissors. Adds a persistent score system using `localStorage`. Users can now keep track of wins, losses, and ties across page reloads.

---

### 09-dom.html  
Introduces basic DOM manipulation. Demonstrates selecting elements and updating their content dynamically using JavaScript.

---

### 09-dom-projects.html  
Contains mini-projects to practice DOM manipulation, including a YouTube Subscribe Button and an Amazon Shipping Calculator. Shows interactive UI updates and event handling.

---

### 09-rock-paper-scissors.html  
Enhanced Rock Paper Scissors game with DOM manipulation. Updates the UI dynamically to display game results and scores without using alert().

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add a scoreboard in the UI instead of using `alert()`.
- Organize code into separate .js files for modularity.
- Add basic CSS for layout and styling.
- Use JavaScript `addEventListener` instead of inline `onclick`.
- Refactor logic into separate JavaScript files.
